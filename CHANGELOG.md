### UI Changes overview

- Generic UI elements like tabs and "cards" (used to denote specific floating sections like the parts on the profile viewer or the sign in screen) have been given a facelift so we're not just using the vanilla Bootstrap styles.
  - The general idea was to go for a more "consistent" look, so that both our custom components and stock ones blend together more. We also figured that they could do with a little eyecandy without compromising on visual clarity.
  - Other changes to those elements, like with tabs, were done for extra visual polish. Tabs now always match the colour of their contents and have no seams, window modal dialogs no longer take up unnecessary width and have a cute little icon :)
- Various elements now use a "hidden", slim scroll bar that only shows when hovering.
- _Many_ tiny nitpicks and inconsistencies addressed.
- The "User Menu" right click menu has been polished and handles very long unbroken names better.
- The sidebar has been slimmed down: buttons replaced action links, and conversation-related actions moved to relevant lists.
  - The note/ messages counters have been integrated into the sidebar too, instead of displaying as a toast dialog on the bottom.
  - All buttons and functions should still be accessible from within a single click though. Aside from the "Edit ads" button, which has been moved to the Ad Launcher, and the Profile Analyser. Which is now no longer a separate window but has been integrated into the profile viewer for your own characters.
  - It should overall feel a bit more familiar to people using modern chat programs.
- BBCode colours for white, gray and black updated in all light/dark themes for legibility; most other colours in the light theme adjusted as they were hard to read.
  - Since this removes the "glow" effect that black text has in certain theme and was used for certain cool effects, the setting for bbcode colours mentioned above also adds the glow back to those colours.
- The light theme has (mostly) been fixed throughout and is now on par with the dark themes.
- Improved visual consistency between the Eicon Picker and the rest of the app.
- The profile viewer has been significantly polished too.
  - The side bar's buttons have been updated to match the look used for other buttons throughout the app.
  - Looking at your own character(s) now shows (preliminary!) buttons similar to the website. You can also see your private friends lists now.
  - The dialog for editing a memo has been changed to match the one in the user right click menu.
  - The profile analyser is now displayed on your own profile instead, inside the collapsible box used for match results on others' profiles.
  - The window will no longer shift around depending on whether or not a profile is loading/ unavailable, smaller or full size. This also includes a nice little loading animation (please do not look up what they're called).
  - Massively nested `[indent]` tags, used to create a padding effect, no longer have their contents completely squashed on narrower screen sizes.
  - Various elements (such as the buttons above the kink list, the "Info" tab's contents and the sidebar's contents now scale properly at various screen sizes.
  - Dropdown items and the kink lists have been slimmed down a bit. The kink lists now have a bit of a coloured flair similar to the website's profile page.
- Buttons on the window title bar now blend in better with the background.
  - On platforms that have a button for the app menu, a specific button was added to directly open the settings. The app menu button has been given a different icon to better show off its purpose.
- Text contrast fixes are now applied globally across appropriate elements (e.g. buttons). [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/8480f9ce4469ca2ef5e0a8e0e9e9b6a12c30cade)
  - This also fixes some cases where theme colours weren't being applied properly to some elements (like conversation lists in the Dracula theme).

### Removed

- Extra, unused CHANGELOG.md in `electron/CHANGELOG.md`. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/8d97fb9aef01638b1d89324e3aa62d0690d9a842)

### Security & Development

- Updated Electron to 37.2.0. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/24791477c245ad9ca25222cfded78871f852d176)
- Updated Vue-Loader to 15.11 so we don't have to deal with Babel Traverse vulnerabilities anymore. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/6ec6ad6840d61fc5776f79732c348d6056acfd13)
- Updated Vue from 2.6 to 2.7. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/8b907f21aeafc08559ff34b1eee5552d1b73eb24)
  - In the 1.32.2 changelog we mentioned wanting to update to Vue 3 and that updates might pause because of that, but going through 2.7 first means we can do the necessary changes gradually instead of having to edge and drop all of the component changes in one go. It's a pain to have to deal with wanting to update a component in the development branch while the Vue 3 branch has to then have those changes backported to them, but the backend also relies on some Vue 2-specific code and slowly whittling this down will probably go way better.
- We now support Gentoo ebuilds! Check out all of our Linux package versions in the [Readme!](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/blob/main/README.md#supported-distros) [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/horizon-packages/commit/9803c4373ebdfbba6e47e4c475b549c3868934f6) by @CodingWithAnxiety
- Made some BBCode parsing code more generic, instead of split up between standard and chat parsers. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/e52dd3b6a7655ffaeeeaa7c2dacea8e2d4861fb2)

## [1.32.2] - 2025-07-05

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We are hard at work updating Horizon to use Vue 3 instead of Vue 2, [which should have been done well during Rising's lifespan](https://blog.vuejs.org/posts/vue-2-eol).
> This means we might slow down a bit on non-pre release updates, until we've gotten 2.0.0 (or whatever version number that would be) in a state where we feel it's stable enough. But unless something goes terribly wrongâ€“ or we wind up with a truckload of bugs as a result of this update process, this won't take more than a few weeks. ðŸ¤žðŸ¤ž
> If you're anxiously waiting for new stuff after this update, and it's been a while. Know that we're probably busy with this.

### Fixed

- Fixed issues where the eicon picker's cache would get corrupted during a botched upgrade to any 1.32.X version from an earlier version. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/9a114a16c688961fa25d9bf90e9b8dd47c1de756)
  - This will also make sure that any `eicons.json` files that have already been broken because of this issue are automatically fixed.
- Fixes some cases where custom name colors wouldn't be applied even though the BBCode formatting was valid. This mostly happened if you had the `[color]` tag inside or right next to another one. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/831ffbc838e5adf656457daa8e2524929086b24f)
- Fixes the external browser setting no longer working in the new settings menu. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/b9b0adf0a75ab07a33cfa4d64eb63569508228f1)
- Fixes some instances where using the wrong capitalisation with an `[icon]` tag would link to an improperly capitalised profile preview. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/93247fd76b134162ae92e6ef450b6756b82b0f7c)
- Fixes the 'About Horizon' window being cut off on Windows. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/6020e542358c465343bd21d7caeffcac9806aa8b)
- Fixes the badge on the taskbar icon disappearing if you close a window and reopen it through the tray icon. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/2d8ab92f5497c3cf490dc4247caa926b2174f6e8)
- Fixes issues where closing the app to dock on MacOS would make the dock icon not respond to input, or let you break the app by clicking stuff in the menu bar you are not supposed to be able to without a window. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/4053389561b0552b18a7265a6108068110cc1e04)
- Fixes a bug where you could break the amount of tabs allowed by using the New Tab shortcut. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/9af50faef58fd34bb2e8809e27eb9d29b992abf4)

### Changed

- System broadcasts are now thrown into the console tab instead of pinging and notifying you for every single conversation you are in. The console tab glows just like if you were pinged when there is an announcement. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/37a54fe06c4e1dfc876bc6b3004ad27cd2403512)
- If "Close to system tray" is enabled, you now get only one tray icon that lets you open any tab, instead of one tray icon per tab. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/0176a37f3ae59a083a7a901b31b785e29aff0d70)

### Development

- Prettier updated to version 3.6.0 [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/1d3e9f3020f23c59a9919b1273c82785e4728c39)
- Cleaned up the profile viewer code so it won't cry about not having a specific tag anymore. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/b4e11d4239b21966de9971a5fa0c553892e705ce)

## [1.32.1] - 2025-06-21

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This update changes the way global settings are accessed. Backing up your logs is recommended.

### Added

- General app settings now have a proper preferences window. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/d1578dc6ccaba15e56e0b1eec758f41887b74d90)
  - You can find it under Horizon > Preferences in the app menu.
  - In the nearby future, most of the character-specific settings will be moved to this global settings menu, where they will be applied globally across your characters. Settings like your pings, or other similar settings that can also be set on a per-conversation level will remain character-specific though. This is mostly for settings that have little business being tied to your character (like font size).

### Fixed

- Installing an update now displays the proper changelog instead of the one from the previous version. Oops! [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/324c9d347e9ec751cca152abf00364438aa7ee12)
- Zoom levels now properly persist throughout app sessions. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/2faa816f5f222ad9ab751665a8ea276f35ff314b)
- Clicking the update prompt now properly closes the app instead of leaving you with a tables window. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/badc733049f3c3342fe1c95011c8e3bcd05d51bb)
- Proxy settings are now properly saved after signing in. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/bd8e42999156a566d840d66fac49488f2ffa1805)
- Having a broken URL for your HQ avatar no longer prevents your custom color from displaying either. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/efe8f252294c140177e842d0928f45e0b82f2adf)
- Fixes the profile assistant linking to a nonexistent page when informing you about HQ portraits. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/3341f88941ffa3ab29830fdd1674fb38367746c1)
- Fixes the "Show friends/ bookmarks in a different colour" setting not working in the Dracula theme. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/267728c5cadfd775955e12c16666c0c07c05455e)
- Minor nitpicky visual fixes. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/bbfbd6b9736ca850677e4e70b30e9183279c96bd) [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/d13e7724a9f805720e507f3c0d3e239182161ca6)

### Development

- Themes now properly track whether they are light or dark. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/5c0e518d40168d187b35fa8d0b09e6a8de9f62e5)

## [1.32.0] - 2025-06-15

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to _downgrade_ from 1.32.0 or later to an earlier version, you will need to manually delete the `eicon.json` file in your Horizon data folder, or the EIcon search window might not show all results anymore.
> Please consult [this](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/blob/main/PRIVACY.md) file on where to find this folder.
> For regular users, this should be no concern though.

### Added

- New EIcon Selector and Store update, significantly improving the EIcon selection UI and handling. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/2439abc9253ca87a510d3ac5bc8abded9f1b5d68)
  - You should see a **_massive_** decrease in memory per tab now, and searching for eicons is now a lot snappier.
  - Also fixes some issues where searchig for EIcons with a leading space wouldn't work. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/b88290eef690fdd3111abae52b6c41124b3e8663)
  - _Also_ fixes the EIcon search potentially messing up if Xariah's API is having issues. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/130d91b7fca64740cf7c08ca05f768fc83d3c0e6)
  - Special thanks to @FireUnderTheMountain for helping investigate this, and subsequently writing the PR.
- Experimental gender matcher rework (community feedback appreciated). [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/7b35203e4e77245ff1864fcf505646bd55855b00)
  - Read more about it [here](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/pull/173).
  - TL;DR: Gender and orientation are now a single score, determined primarily by your default kink gender preferences, while your orientation is used as a fallback. Orientation matching for nonbinary characters is also less dogmatic now.
  - More changes to the matcher are planned, including reassessing how species are determined.
- Consistency applied to most instances of the app name. We are now just "Horizon". [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/8f6abc30ffcfd6cfd1b1e4f64e494b56efbff1da)
  - We have a _temporary_ new logo to go with this change. If you don't like it, don't worry: We'll replace it with something better and less temporary soon enough. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/937182c1e30c5a99e0e5ace5f574cba22ba61662) [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/3a54fae7bff6da9af9e11a82d2b2adc04c57758e)

- Fixed a 3.0-era issue where the text box wouldn't properly resize once the line count increased. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/a5bc4495253fc6e58d27e66c2dec9e10e2868e92)
- Your own ads should no longer be marked as compatible/ incompatible when returning to a channel after having posted one. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/205560abc43ccc850aa1a5bd6ec7cd825de45e64)

### Changed

- General UI/UX improvements for some icons. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/9e3520a906798e1f4b295e2167576c38ad9406c3) [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit//08b775bc696bf4c78c0bce1a7035789c2b566149)
- Installing a specific version now shows the changelog for that version, rather than the main branch. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/8b349bd6279f73558edf1290c0f371063d6106ce)
- The automatic update check can be toggled in the settings wheel. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/fed136f0169fe8d4c10af45042a6759cd6f9c867)

### Development

- Running a development versionâ€” either locally through `pnpm build` or from a Pull Request, now displays this in the version info. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/35b283e9f5a9c2e462d9552348e33bccb9131e62)
- App window related functions have been moved to their own file, to debloat the over bloated `electron/main.ts` file. [[Commit]

## [1.31.1] - 2024-05-25

- Support for setting an HTTP proxy. This can be found underneath the advanced settings when you sign in. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/fefe8821fcd3363a56f90b6abc9f710b4ddce625)
- Added `imgchest.com` as a High-Quality Portrait domain, and updated privacy/profile recommendations to mention it. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/50938a2407e6c4fb80ec301180a899bef5df0263)
- Added "Copy url" option to character gallery images. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/17624fb3f5d1cc594cf95187b434b6adc6222c65)
- New keyboard shortcuts: Use `Alt+Shift` + arrow keys to jump between channels/conversations with unread messages; use `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+Alt` + arrow keys to jump between channels/conversations with mentions. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/42d57388454473c5e3e6459066bcb629b678d3b0)

### Fixed

- Fixed the Open Conversation and Join Channel buttons being draggable and messing up the Alt+Arrow keys order. Also fixed an issue where the Open Conversation modal would eat the conversation view. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/ea982ddec8be589b0bed9dd0444c5ffef2a0c0da)

- Reverted a previous change that was causing issues with displaying the match result while searching for characters because of an event listener check. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/849e2ce7c9a516c0da4be6f7d3bcaa3af4315f18)

## [1.31.0] - 2024-05-09

> [!WARNING]
> This is a major update!
> Please, back up your logs.

### Added

- A new setting to notify you when a friend or bookmark logs in. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/c5b401f59db98450ceede0818c9f85d74a95e737)
- The 'Smart Filter' automated reply message can now be customized. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/3edab4956b0121cd711c1e67abb4d279bdfcd69d)
  - This also shuffles the related settings around, and hopefully explains the system a bit better.
- A new setting to display gender symbols next to character names. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/1ae7b9cd2c634b481e83aaee5823627a06decb8c)
  - These symbols can (optionally) retain the original gendered name colour for characters using a custom colour.
- Automated update checks. The settings button on top-- or on Mac, a new one only visible when there's an update, will glow when a new version of Horizon is available for download. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/b9189fe9f123dcd2d7a6d6c939e48d744401504b)
  - This also brings back and repurposes the old 3.0 beta channel setting, for checking if pre-release versions are available.

### Fixed

- Fixed icon position in the MacOS installer. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/c73f0549033f53ba679a19cd3946b7e9ebaba1b8)
- Issues with event listeners being assigned twice. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/c1e53c796df75960d34b0e8225e89e3c96a81ff0)
  - This should solve ads showing up more than once in the Recon tab and Ad History menu.
- Character-specific settings potentially being loaded before logging in. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/97e611734bdd0112596f8611e20bcd855e3c90ac)
  - This should fix showing not being able to view logs without logging in first.
- Fixed an issue where the bottom padding of the window would not readjust after maximizing the window (most noticeable by the chat input being cut off) .[[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/520226c026d73b5c9e1164e005150328f17a4a96)
- Fixed event listeners not being properly removed after logging out [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/be76897b0c9596c6663705cc457aadb69be0543d)
  - This should fix issues like Alt-â†‘ and Alt-â†“ making you scroll through multiple conversations instead of only one after relogging.
- Fixed conversation list items not changing color in the Dracula theme when hovering over them. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/8a99eb47f3694ddb130aa94b30d37e6d1473b209)
- Fixed cases where conversations could be opened with a nameless character. This would (incorrectly) give a warning about corrupted logs. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/05c763a8955f1113732139cda1a18f33907d7fc4)
  - This also fixes other cases where using slash-commands with an empty name could allow for weird things happening (like ignoring a nameless character).
- Fixed notifications on Windows being labelled by the app's ID instead of the app's name, and clicking a notification while the app is minimized should restore it properly now. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/782236d6574f7e1c3b9686ae71be4df4d1b77637)

### Changed

- Tool tips in the BBCode editor now reflect platform-specific (MacOS) shortcuts. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/40b2ffe)
- Names beyond a certain length are now truncated in the user list, to prevent the layout from breaking. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/b828eb3172ca2f254bd45bec86beef4daf4e6378)
  - This should only affect extreme cases, where a name consists of over Â±18 capital letters.
- Character status icons (Looking, Online, Busy, etc.) in the conversation list now match the ones in the user list. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/e0865a9a042ef07b96284898e8b109a6202877ce)
- On MacOS, the shortcut to open the developer tools window now matches the one used in Chrome and Safari on that platform (Command-Option-I). [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/0614adee072d15a5cce46a56a6d0477dec0c9065)

### Non-user facing changes (for developers)

- Fixes the release artefacts directory not being ignored by Git and Prettier. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/b5eff723787c1aa9250ba0dbc8db84b1fda3c7f5)
- Removed an unnecessary `include` in `tsconfig.json` that potentially confused LSPs. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/0d1926306bbef569a65da0b93d99d1fb25ed4cc5)
- The Prettier pre-commit hook now warns developers _before_ they make a commit, rather than after. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/pull/129/commits/f954d6ec685ea672300a2253553ae5c93d54b13d)
  - This behaviour can be ignored by using `git commit --no-verify [...]`
  - The Prettier format check is also part of the PR CI/CD pipeline now.
